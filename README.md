# EmpiricalAnalysis-CSE2046

The main goal of this project is to design an experiment to compare the 
theoretical and empirical results of sorting algorithms. According to our observations,
we will do some analysis with plots and tables.

# Comparing All Algorithms

Figure 21 Average Inputs vs Sorting Algorithms
According to this graph, the worst algorithms for average cases are binary 
insertion and insertion algorithms. Insertion sort algorithms are more efficient if the 
input size is small, not appropriate for large arrays.
